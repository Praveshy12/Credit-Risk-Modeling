# Credit Risk Modeling

This project predicts the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan using various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Features:
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- ROC-AUC and Confusion Matrix evaluation

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the model training:

python train_model.py

## Results:
The project evaluates the model's ability to predict credit risk and provides insights into financial decision-making.
